        	<td>Keep Barbecue Grills Clean and Maintained -  Regularly check that burner ports are free of debris, and examine the hose and its connections for leaks using a 50/50 solution of water and dish soap – if you see bubbles when the gas is on it means you have a leak. When in use, never leave a barbecue unattended and keep it away from fences, vinyl siding or anything that can burn. In the event of a grease fire, douse the flames with baking soda (keep a box on hand) or a fire extinguisher. Water will only spread the flames.</td>

            <td>Remove lint from your dryer filter after every use - A clogged filter and lint trap make your dryer less efficient, reduces the airflow needed to keep heat from building up in vents, and forces lint onto the heating coils. Also, never let your dryer run when you’re out of the house or when you’re asleep.</td>

            <td>Store containers of cooking oil well away from the stove - When cooking with oil, never leave the stove unattended. To stop a grease fire, turn off the burner and place a lid on the pan to suffocate the flames, or pour on lots of baking soda. Never pour water on a grease fire or try to carry the pan outside; water splatters the grease and makes the fire bigger, and the pan will be much too hot to carry.</td>
